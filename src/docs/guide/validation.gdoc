Griffon validation capabilities are inspired in [Spring's Validator API|http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/package-summary.html]. However Griffon takes this further and provides a unified way to define validation "constraints" with its constraints mechanism.

Constraints in Griffon are a way to declaratively specify validation rules. Most commonly they are applied to Domain classes, however Command Objects also support constraints.
